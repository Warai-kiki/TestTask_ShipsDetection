The test program obtained in the course of execution fulfills the specified conditions. It allows you to define the necessary objects, 
namely ships, in the image with an accuracy of more than 20%. 
The program is implemented in the form of two files, one of which is responsible for providing a clear interface to the user and downloading the necessary {{1 }} for working with images, and the second - for direct work with the image and displaying the result of processing to the user. The result of 
processing is an image in .jpg format, on which all detected objects matching the description of the ship are highlighted in blue frames, 
and the percentage of similarity with the desired object is indicated.
