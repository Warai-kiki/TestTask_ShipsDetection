# TestTask_ShipsDetection
This program, using the ImageAi library, analyzes the image in search of matches with the searched objects. 
The search results are recorded in a new image, which displays the percentage of matches with the desired object (more than 20% similarity). 
The user is provided with a simple interface with the ability to download the file. The interface is implemented using the TKinter library.
